# 🛠️ Single-Room Cabin Structural Analysis with OpenSeesPy

This repository contains the OpenSeesPy model and Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of a single-room cabin. This project was undertaken as a hands-on learning exercise during post-B.Tech holidays to reinforce theoretical understanding of FEM in a practical structural engineering context.

## 🔹 Project Highlights

* Idealized slab loading as a uniformly varying load (UVL) on the beams.
* Utilized two equivalent Uniformly Distributed Loads (UDLs) to accurately preserve the maximum bending moment, simplifying analysis while maintaining precision.
* Modeled plinth beams with UDLs to effectively simulate wall loads.

## 📈 What Was Gained

* Enhanced visualization of internal forces (bending moments, reactions, displacements), truly connecting theoretical concepts to practical outcomes.
* Experimented with multiple model setups, gaining deeper insights into FEM behavior under varying idealizations and problem-solving scenarios.
* Discovered the immense power and flexibility of [OpenSeesPy](https://openseespydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) combined with Python for streamlining structural engineering workflows.
